# About Me
I'm a Network Engineer and Developer living in New Zealand. Outside the office I obsess over my own projects which are still tech related.

Some of the things I work on in my free time are:
* A Valheim Server I've configured for my friends.  
* Fine tuning my own Fedora workstation. It uses Xmonad as its' tiling manager which lets me configure every aspect of its' UI.
* Random programming projects. Done mostly to sharpen my skill.

I love learning through doing, so I work on projects to learn tech such as Docker, bash, Python, Haskell, etc. I also love creating and refining complex systems designed to solve problemsâ€”be it a minor gripe or a high-impact business problem. 
An analogue skill that I always work on is cooking, especially Korean and Filipino recipes. My partner says I make a mean Lumpiang Shanghai and Adobo and I'm proud of that.

If you have a project you reckon I can help with, don't hesitate to get in touch through my LinkedIn at:
